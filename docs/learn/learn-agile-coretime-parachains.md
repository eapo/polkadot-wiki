The landscape for parachains on {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }}
changes with the rollout of [Agile Coretime](./learn-agile-coretime.md). With
[auctions](./learn-auction.md) being phased out in favor of direct coretime sales, the existing
parachains on the relaychain and the prospective parachains are presented with the following
scenarios:

- Migrating from a legacy lease into a bulk coretime model
- Starting with bulk coretime model from scratch
- Running a parachain with on-demand coretime purchases
